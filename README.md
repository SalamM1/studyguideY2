# Study Guide 2018-19
A study guide document compiling the basics from each course I studied in Year 2 CS.  
The study guide is written in LaTeX by student Faisal Alrajhi.  
This is not an official guide and has no direct relation to the School of Computer Science or University of Birmingham; it is made by me to study for my exam and should not be used as a reference for anything relating to the courses or exams.
